# pile-subtraction
Small game of subtracting piles of stone from each other


The rules to the Three-Pile Subtraction game are as follows:
1. The game begins with some number of stones distributed into three dierent piles.
2. Two players take turns removing stones from one of the piles, where a move consist of removing
the number of stones in one pile from another pile (i.e., subtracting one pile from another).
3. A player may not remove more stones from a pile than the pile contains; i.e., you must always
subtract smaller numbers from larger numbers.
4. A player must remove at least one stone on their turn; a pile of zero stones is eectively out
of the game.
5. Play continues until no valid moves remain, and the last player to make a move wins. This
will happen when there are two empty piles of stones.
